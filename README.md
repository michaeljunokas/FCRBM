# Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Data Synthesis

This repository explores the application of FCRBM for data synthesis in a variety of different domains. Based on work presented in Junokas (2018), it refactors the dissertations MATLAB code into Python, tranistioning to a tensorflow/keras implementation of deep learning.
