FACTORED RBM TESTS

- WORKING EXPERIMENT 1

	sampling two combo freq-mod sounds:
		AUDIO1	=	oscillating every 2000 samples
		AUDIO2	=	oscillating every 4000 samples
	
	with
			FFT = 4000
			hop = 4000
			no tapering window
			
			order = 2
			numhid = 4
			numfac = 4
			numfeat = 2
			maxEpoch = 2500 (could probably be less...)

	using 	sTrainingAndDataPrepNoBatch.m with gaussianfaccrbmAUDIOnoBatch (CRBM with factored weights)
			sGenerateNoBatch.m with genfaccrbm (respective generative function)
			
	was able to faithfully reproduce initialized audio ad infinitum
	
	
- WORKING EXPERIMENT 2

	same as above except
		FFT = 2000
		order = 4
		
	error was high, but that is expected is the sounds are very different... should code to look at the
	difference between successive error rates.
	
		***	erRate check implemented in Factored RBM ***
		
		
- WORKING EXPERIMENT 3

	same as above except
		FFT = 1000
		order = 8
		
	works but getting fuzzy....with new erRate measure, finished in 2466 epochs
		

- WORKING EXPERIMENT 4

	same as above except
		FFT = 2000
		hop = FFTwindow/2
		order = 8
		epochs = 2934
